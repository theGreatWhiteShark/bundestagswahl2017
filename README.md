In this projects we want to have a look at various data of the election of the Bundestag 2017 as well as various statistics of the city of Dresden.

We want to raise some important and maybe controversial questions and hypothesis, test them in a scientifically sound way, and provide all the data as well as all the scripts to the general public.

# Data

The [data](data) folder will contain all the references and scripts to download, extract, and tidy the data.

# R

The document [cartogram_newman.md](R/cartogram_newman.md) guides you through the generation of cartograms using the original source code of Mark Newman's diffusion map-bases approach.

# c

Contains the [original](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/) [source code](c/cart.c) of Mark Newman for calculating the diffusion-based cartogram.
